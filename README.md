# waveSharp 0_1 prototype application (2023-jan-07)

## second release 2023-jan-07 (currently WIN64 only, LINUX/MAC release pending)
downloads https://github.com/CorBer/waveSharp/releases/tag/v0_1

This is the second release (freeware) of the waveSharp project.  The aim of this project is to recreate the RegiStax6(RS6) wavelet sharpening module.  RS6 was developed in 2011 only for windows 32bit computers, waveSharp is developed for 64bit computers and multiple operating systems. Therefore this application is only meant to sharpen/enhance images that have been created using other software (alignment/stacking). 

The development of this release of waveSharp was done in close collaboration with:

- Grant Blair
- Michael Owen
- Filip Szczerek
- Cheng-Yang Tan
- Don Capone

I want to thank them first of all for helping me get started and spending part of their free time on this. They have tested many earlier versions of the application and provided both help/bugs and ideas that helped me steering this project.  

### PROTOTYPE
This application should be seen as a PROTOTYPE with still limited functionality as it (yet) does not cover all RS6 options for post-processing stacked-images and many of new (not available in RS6) features compared to the initial DEMO have not been tested at a wider usebase.

## update on 2022-12-21
An updated version of the 1st release for windows is available that solves the issues with saving to TIFF and issues with the interface due to scaling (**waveSharp_WIN64_20221221.zip**)

## update on 2022-12-20
The windows version has been updated since saving to TIFF was not possible.
