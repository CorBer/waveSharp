# waveSharp 002_3 DEMO application (2022-dec-19)
## release planned for 2022-12-19
This repository will hold the first public release (freeware) of the waveSharp project.  The aim of this project is to recreate the RegiStax6(RS6) wavelet sharpening module.  RS6 was developed in 2011 only for windows 32bit computers, waveSharp is developed for 64bit computers multiple operating systems. Therefore this application is only ment to sharpen/enhance images that have been created using other software (alignment/stacking). 

The development of waveSharp was done in close collaboration with:
- Grant Blair
- Michael Owen
- Filip Szczerek
- Cheng-Yang Tan

I want to thank them first of all for helping me get started and spending part of their free time on this. They have tested many (over 50) earlier versions of the application and provided both help/bugs and ideas that helped me steering this project.
