# waveSharp2 development tools (2024 11 21)
WaveSharp was Built using only free tools. The sourcecode for all versions was build using the **Lazarus IDE** (https://www.lazarus-ide.org/) and using the **FreePascal** Compiler(https://www.freepascal.org/) these free and well designed tools have allowed me to create at the same time windows and linux versions. Starting with the V2 version we will also be using **Python** (https://www.python.org/) as a workhorse for more complex operations that would be either difficult to design in pascal or are too slow. To do this we needed a bridge between Lazarus/FreePascal and Python to allow fast/easy flow of data. The **Python4Delphi** (https://github.com/pyscripter/python4delphi) libraries/components have proven to allow all of this. Finally to make installing for new users as easy as possible we used **InnoSetup** (https://jrsoftware.org).
I want to thank all the developers involved in creating/providing all of the above (free) tools.
